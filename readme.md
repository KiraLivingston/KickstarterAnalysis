# **An  Analysis of the Kickstarter Campaign**

## The purpose of this analysis is to use the kickstarter data to develop successful campaign outcomes based on fundraising goals and campaign launch dates.


# **Analysis and Challenges**

>### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
>The kickstarter datawas used to analyze outcomes of campaigns in regards to launch dates and fundraising goal amounts.  The biggest challenge that I found while completing the analysis was filtering the data correctly to produce the desired outcomes. The challenge was overcome by consistently removing filters before manipulating data sets to ensure complete data analysis.

## **Results**
>One conclusion drawn about theater outcomes by launch dates is that late Spring is the best time to launch a successful theater campaign.  Another conclusion is that failed theater campaigns do not seem to be affected by launch dates. This leads to the conclusion that successful theater campaigns are more positively related to outcomes based on funding goals. Lower funding goals have produced successful theater campaigns.
>Of course there are limits to this dataset and it would be interesting to see where the data set is coming from in regards to demographics related to the people funding the campaigns.  It would be interesting to compile more data specific to the four seasons of the year to see what contributes to a more successful spring campaign.
